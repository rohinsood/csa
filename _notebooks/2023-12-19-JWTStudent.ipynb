    "\n",
    "★ **Asymmetric Signing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**JWT**: Supports asymmetric signing using a public/private key pair, providing a more robust security model.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**SWT**: Limited to symmetric signing with HMAC, which may have implications for key management and security.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "★ **Versatility in Key Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**JWT**: Allows the use of various key types, including X.509 certificates, enhancing flexibility in key management strategies.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**SWT**: Primarily relies on shared secrets for signing, limiting the range of available key types.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "★ **Ease of Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**JWT**: Typically considered easier to implement due to its simpler structure and support for common web development libraries.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**SWT and SAML**: May involve more complex implementations, especially in the case of XML-based SAML tokens.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "★ **Compatibility with Modern Web Standards:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**JWT**: Aligns well with modern web development practices, RESTful APIs, and JSON-based communication, making it a natural fit for contemporary applications.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**SWT and SAML**: May be perceived as more traditional or heavyweight, with SAML using XML, which could be less favorable in certain contexts.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "★ **Token Size and Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**JWT**: Typically has a more compact size due to its JSON format, leading to more efficient transmission and reduced overhead.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**SWT and SAML**: May have larger token sizes, especially in the case of XML-based SAML, potentially impacting network performance.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "★ **Community Adoption:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**JWT**: Enjoying widespread adoption in the developer community, with extensive support in libraries, frameworks, and platforms.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**SWT and SAML**: While still used in various scenarios, they may not be as widely adopted or preferred in modern web development.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "★ **Standardization and Interoperability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**JWT**: Benefits from standardized specifications, promoting interoperability between different systems and services.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**SWT and SAML**: While standardized, may face challenges in terms of interoperability and compatibility in diverse environments.</span>\n",

    "## Unauthenticated User Redirect\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in Java, the concept of unauthenticated user redirect typically involves handling situations where a user tries to access a protected resource without proper authentication. JWT is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of how unauthenticated user redirect might be implemented in Java with JWT:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authentication Process:**\n",
    "   - When a user tries to access a <mark>protected</mark> resource, they need to include a valid JWT token in their request.\n",
    "   - The server verifies the JWT token's signature and checks its claims to ensure the user is authenticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Unauthenticated Users:**\n",
    "   - If the user is not authenticated (i.e., they don't provide a valid JWT token or the token is expired), the server identifies them as an <mark>unauthenticated</mark> user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Redirect Mechanism:**\n",
    "   - Instead of directly denying access, a common approach is to redirect the unauthenticated user to a login page or an authentication <mark>authentication</mark>.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Java Implementation:**\n",
    "   - In Java, you might use a web framework like Spring Boot for building your application.\n",
    "   - Spring Security is commonly used for handling authentication and authorization.\n",

    "A JWT, or JSON Web Token, is like a digital badge for online users and websites. When you log in, the server hands you a special token that contains encoded information about you, such as your username or user ID. This token is like a secure badge that proves your identity. When you want to do something on the website, you present this token, and the website's server uses its secret key to check if the token is valid and hasn't been tampered with. If everything checks out, it trusts the information in the token, allowing you to securely interact with the site. Essentially, a JWT acts as a secure way for your online identity to be verified and trusted, making your online activities safer and more reliable."
