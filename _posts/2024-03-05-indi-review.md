# Project Work
- Individual Feature
  - I worked on creating an admin feature, where certain roles would have protected routes
  - Learned about ORM, env variables, & accessing JWT in the backend
- Team work
  - Since this is a team with a pretty high mean skill, I took less of a leadership position as a whole and did my best to work with those in my group to integrate features
    - James & communication
  - [Pull requests for individual features](https://github.com/CSA-AI/CSA_AI_Backend/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
