# LSTM Feedback
- At Night at the Museum, a specific parent who was coincidentally a professor of machine learning at UCSD, asked us questions along the lines of:
 - How accurate and reliable is the LSTM model in predicting stock prices?
 - Did this align with real world data?
 - How did you ensure diversity and transparency about the training? Are we doing this ethically?
- He gave us feedback on how we could train the model using Python and outsource all the training to a server, separate from AWS

# UI Feedback
- From the general list of parents, they were a big fan of the UI
- Suggested to add visuals that would help explain AI and how the stock market works.
- We will touch it up and make it easier to understand in the future

# Demo/Team Reflection
- Grows:
  - We could improve on the fluidity/transitions between people when presenting
  - Each individual feature, although connected, and unique specific parts
- Glows:
  - Engaged audience with visuals
  - Easy to follow UI
  - Good eye contact
  - Asking them questions
- Personally, I could have improved by taking more of an assertive role and explaining the big idea of the project, instead of just my original feature
