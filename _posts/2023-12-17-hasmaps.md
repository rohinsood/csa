# Key Concepts in HashMaps and SQLite Databases in Java

## HashMaps in Java
- Understanding the HashMap data structure in Java.
- Key-value pairs, hashing, and principles of HashMap.

## HashMap Operations
- Performing basic operations on HashMaps: insertion, retrieval, and deletion.
- Iterating through keys and values in a HashMap.

## HashMap API
- Exploring the HashMap class methods and functionalities in the Java API.
- Practical use cases and examples.

## Handling Collisions
- Dealing with collisions in HashMaps and strategies for resolution.
- Collision resolution techniques: chaining and open addressing.

## Performance Considerations
- Analyzing the time complexity of HashMap operations.
- Choosing appropriate initial capacity and load factor for optimal performance.

## SQLite Database in Java
- Introduction to SQLite as a lightweight relational database management system.
- Setting up and connecting to an SQLite database in Java.

## JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Utilizing JDBC for database operations in Java.
- Establishing connections, executing queries, and handling results.

## Creating and Managing Tables
- Designing and creating tables in an SQLite database.
- Defining data types, constraints, and relationships.

## CRUD Operations

- Translating Java objects to database records and vice versa.

## Prepared Statements
- Using prepared statements for efficient and secure database operations.
- Preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Transactions
- Understanding database transactions and their role in ensuring data integrity.
- Implementing atomic operations and rollback mechanisms.

## Querying the Database
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve specific data from the database.
- Utilizing SELECT statements with conditions and joins.

## Connection Pooling
- Implementing connection pooling for efficient database connections.
- Enhancing performance and scalability in database operations.

## Error Handling and Exception Management
- Handling database-related errors and exceptions in Java.
- Implementing robust error-handling strategies.

## Best Practices and Optimization
- Adhering to best practices for efficient HashMap and SQLite database usage.
- Optimizing queries and data access for better performance.
