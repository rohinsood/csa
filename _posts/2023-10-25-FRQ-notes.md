# FRQ Type 1: Array Operations

## Accessing Elements
- Use square brackets to access elements by their index.
- Array indices start from 0.

## Modifying Elements
- Elements in an array can be changed by assigning a new value to a specific index.
- Use a for loop to iterate over an array and modify its elements.

# FRQ Type 2: ArrayList Operations

## Adding Elements
- Use the `add` method to insert elements at the end of an ArrayList.
- You can also insert elements at a specific index using the `add(index, element)` method.

## Removing Elements
- The `remove` method allows you to delete an element by specifying its index.
- You can also remove elements by value using the `remove(Object o)` method.

# FRQ Type 3: String Manipulation

## Concatenation
- Strings can be combined using the `+` operator.
- The `concat` method can also be used for concatenation.

## Substring
- Extract a portion of a string using the `substring` method.
- Specify the start and end indices to obtain the desired substring.

# FRQ Type 4: Object-Oriented Programming

## Classes and Objects
- Classes define the blueprint for objects, including attributes and methods.
- Objects are instances of classes, created with the `new` keyword.

## Inheritance
- Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit properties and methods from a superclass.
- The `extends` keyword is used to establish inheritance.

# FRQ Type 5: Searching and Sorting Algorithms

## Linear Search
- Linear search iterates through an array to find a specific element.
- It has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case.

## Quick Sort
- Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach.
- It has an average time complexity of O(n log n).

# FRQ Type 6: Recursion

## Base Case
- Recursion must have a base case to terminate the recursive calls.
- The base case defines when the recursion stops.

## Recursive Calls
- In a recursive function, it calls itself with different parameters.
- Each recursive call moves closer to the base case.
