# Key Concepts in JWT Integration with Spring

## Introduction to JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Understanding the basics of JWT as a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims.
- JWT structure: Header, Payload, Signature.

## Spring Security Configuration
- Configuring Spring Security for JWT authentication.
- Integration of JWT authentication filters.

## Token Generation and Signing
- Generating JWTs on successful user authentication.
- Signing JWTs using a secret key or asymmetric keys.

## User Authentication and Authorization
- Authenticating users using JWT.
- Authorizing users based on roles and permissions stored in JWT claims.

## Token Validation
- Implementing mechanisms to validate incoming JWTs.
- Checking token expiration, integrity, and other claims.

## Customizing JWT Claims
- Adding custom claims to JWT for additional user information.
- Leveraging claims for application-specific requirements.

## Refresh Tokens
- Implementing refresh token functionality for extended user sessions.
- Strategies for securely handling refresh tokens.

## Storing JWTs
- Choosing appropriate storage mechanisms for JWTs.
- Considerations for stateless and stateful token storage.

## Revoking JWTs
- Implementing token revocation mechanisms.
- Handling compromised tokens and user logouts.

## Handling Token Expiration
- Dealing with expired JWTs in a secure and user-friendly manner.
- Implementing token refresh or reauthentication.

## CSRF Protection with JWT
- Ensuring Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in JWT-based authentication.
- Strategies for mitigating CSRF attacks.

## Spring Boot Integration
- Integrating JWT authentication with Spring Boot applications.
- Leveraging Spring Boot features for seamless JWT integration.

## Logging and Auditing
- Implementing logging and auditing for JWT-related activities.
- Monitoring and tracking JWT usage.

## Best Practices and Security Considerations
- Adhering to best practices for secure JWT implementation.
- Considering security implications and potential vulnerabilities.

## Testing JWT Integration
- Writing tests to ensure the correct functioning of JWT authentication.
- Unit testing and integration testing strategies.
