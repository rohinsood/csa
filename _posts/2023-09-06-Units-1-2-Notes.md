# Unit 1: Introduction to Java

## Basics of Java
- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language.
- Java programs consist of classes and methods.

## Hello, World!
- The classic "Hello, World!" program in Java:
  ```java
  public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```

# Unit 2: Data Types and Operators

## Primitive Data Types
- **int**: Represents integers (e.g., -42, 0, 100).
- **double**: Represents floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, 2.718).
- **char**: Represents a single character (e.g., 'A', '$').
- **boolean**: Represents true or false.

## Variables and Assignment
- Declare and assign a variable:
  ```java
  int age = 25;
  double pi = 3.1415;
  char grade = 'A';
  boolean isStudent = true;
  ```

## Arithmetic Operators
- Basic arithmetic operators:
  - Addition: `+`
  - Subtraction: `-`
  - Multiplication: `*`
  - Division: `/`
  - Modulo: `%`

## Comparison Operators
- Comparison operators return boolean values:
  - Equal to: `==`
  - Not equal to: `!=`
  - Greater than: `>`
  - Less than: `<`
  - Greater than or equal to: `>=`
  - Less than or equal to: `<=`

## Logical Operators
- Logical operators for combining conditions:
  - AND: `&&`
  - OR: `||`
  - NOT: `!`

## Conditional Statements
- `if` statement:
  ```java
  if (condition) {
      // Code to execute if the condition is true
  }
  ```

- `else` statement:
  ```java
  if (condition) {
      // Code to execute if the condition is true
  } else {
      // Code to execute if the condition is false
  }
  ```
