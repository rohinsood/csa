# Question 37 Explanation:
You have a code, and when it runs, it prints the string "CarHouseGorilla." The code has a missing part, represented as / * missing code * /. Three different code segments are suggested as replacements. We need to understand what each replacement does and why it results in the specified output. The task involves completing a code snippet. The code aims to concatenate parts of an array of words in a specific order to form the string "CarHouseGorilla." The missing code should accomplish this.

---

**Option I:**
```java
for (int k = startIndex; k < words.length; k++)
    result += words[k] + words[words.length - k - 1];
```
- Correctness: ✅
- Explanation: This loop iterates over the array, concatenating words in a pattern. It correctly creates the desired string.

---

**Option II:**
```java
int k = words.length - 1;
while (k >= startIndex)
    result += words[k--];
```
- Correctness: ✅
- Explanation: This is an alternative loop that also correctly concatenates words in reverse order until the startIndex is reached.

---

**Option III:**
```java
String[] temp = new String[words.length];
for (int k = 0; k <= words.length / 2; k++)
    temp[k] = words[words.length - k - 1];
temp[words.length - k - 1] = words[k];
for (int k = 0; k < temp.length - startIndex; k++)
    result += temp[k];
```
- Correctness: ❌
- Explanation: This option has a flaw. It attempts to reverse the order of words using a temporary array but doesn't handle the concatenation correctly, resulting in an incorrect output.

---

In summary, Options I and II are correct, but Option III is incorrect due to a mistake in handling the temporary array and concatenation.
